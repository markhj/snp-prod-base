## ✍️ Writing viewers
This repo is public and contains all the instructions used to organize and visualize the content shown at ``snippets.it.com``.

Therefore, it's possible for everyone to write tools to retrieve and view the snippets. Our website is just one of many ways to do it.

If you want to write another website with different features, CLIs, GUIs or apps, feel free to do so.
If you want your viewer listed, open an **Issue** and select a **feature-request**.
